# coursera_pml_course_project
Course project for [Practical Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/predmachlearn-011)

Built a simple random forest estimator in R to make predictions on the Weight Lifting Exercise from [Groupware's HAR page](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

You're better off reading the [gh-pages](https://balladeer.github.io/coursera_pml_course_project/) page for this repo; it explains much more of what went into this project.
